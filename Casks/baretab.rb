  # The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID), so Gatekeeper would refuse to open it.
  # Clearing the quarantine flag lets it launch normally.

  caveats <<~EOS
    BareTab needs Accessibility access to take over Command-Tab:
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility > enable BareTab
    Because the app is not notarized, macOS may ask you to grant this again after an upgrade.
